## Here is the list of things I was lately busy with:

- [ ] :rocket: Udacity program [Data Engineering with Azure](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd0277/) provides a good headstart (or refresh) on the concepts of data warehouses, data lakes and, also, data lakehouses...so, everything-data + using Azure as an example platform. Hands-on part includes DIY mini-projects with Azure Synapse, Databricks and Pipelines.  
  Project repository [fluentnumbers/udacity_DE_with_Azure](https://github.com/fluentnumbers/udacity_DE_with_Azure/tree/main) contains all the homeworks and serves as a fully reproducible guide of the course.

- [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub)
  Community of volunteers facilitating several top-class **free** _zoomcamps_ with very practice-heavy requirements for obtaining certificates and lively Slack-community.
  
  - [ ] :rocket: MLOps Zoomcamp
    Project: [fluentnumbers/portfolio_mlops](https://github.com/fluentnumbers/portfolio_mlops) features end-to-end MLOps pipeline built around an NLP task, but applicable as a template to any ML problem. Check out the techstack inside.  
  - [x] :rocket: Data Engineering Zoomcamp  
    Project: [fluentnumbers/ecommerce_behavior](https://github.com/fluentnumbers/ecommerce_behavior) examplifies how data analytics pipeline can be build for an ecommerce dataset - from scheduled data injection to hosted dashboards.
